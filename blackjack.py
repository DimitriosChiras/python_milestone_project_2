# 1) Create a deck of 52 cards
# 2) Shuffle the deck
# 3) Ask the Player for their bet/define their chips
# 4) Make sure that the Player's bet does not exceed their available chips
# 5) Deal two cards to the Dealer and two cards to the Player
# 6) Show only one of the Dealer's cards, the other remains hidden
# 7) Show both of the Player's cards
